Day 5: Output Behavior Monitoring & Drift Detection

- Implemented output behavior monitoring using transformer embeddings
- Applied mean pooling and cosine similarity for drift detection
- Compared real-time model outputs against baseline behavior
- Distinguished between malicious input attempts and actual output drift
- Integrated output anomaly results into the FastAPI /analyze endpoint

Status: Completed
